# Extension Template (React / TypeScript)

# Extension Development Quickstart Guide

```
yarn create-looker-extension <name>
cd <name>
yarn install
yarn start
```

Your new looker extension app is running locally. Likely at `https://localhost:8080`.

Now navigate to the Looker Marketplace on your instance

`<instance_url>.com/marketplace`

Head to the `Plug-ins` category and Install the `Extension Quickstart` extension.
It will ask you to specify a name for your `extension` as well as a user facing `Label` and optional `port`.

Select the browse dropdown and your new extension will be listed!

Click on your extension to see it in action!
